I had a brilliant chat today with a principle developer that really opened my eyes to understanding TDD.  I thought I'd conquered it, understanding that TDD boiled down to a discipline where unit tests were written before the solution code.



Turns out that I'd only got around 10% of the story.  TDD has many more nuances than I realised.  The whole red-green-refactor thing was something I'd heard about but didn't really _understand_.  So I'm now embarking upon the learning curve of TDD.  I'll share my thoughts as I go along... but in the meantime, only say you understand TDD if you _understand_ TDD!  Thanks :-)
