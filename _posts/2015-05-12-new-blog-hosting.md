New blog style.  Like it?

Well, more than a new blog style.  A new blog engine, and a totally different way for me to add content.  Hopefully a way that will suit me better and ultimately lead to me writing more posts!

So before I tell you why I've changed it, I'll tell you what I've done.  Previously the site was a Wordpress blog running on Windows in Amazon AWS.  It was a micro instance I'd started with my free first year and installed Wordpress onto it.  I chose it at the time because it was easy to set up and use, and gave me a bit of exposure to AWS.  I'd also tested Wordpress out on my Synology NAS beforehand so was happy with the blog engine.  In hindsight setting up an EC2 box isn't *really* going to teach much about AWS but that's something to discuss in a future post.

My free year ran out and it started to cost me Â£15 a month to run.  Not ideal but not overly expensive, I was more annoyed that for the money I wasn't really learning much.  The backup procedure wasn't really slick though, and I wasn't keen on the database under the hood.  I really wanted something with a bit more source control over the content.

So now it runs on Jekyll, hosted on Github Pages.  Really easy to set up.  I write my blog posts in a Ubuntu VM because I found Jekyll wasn't always happy running on Windows, but I'm fine with that.  I like the simple text format of the blog posts (everything is written in markdown) and the control I have over layout and presentation.  The inbuilt source control from Github.  The fact it costs me nothing to run yet it's quick.  Loads of different things.

Oh, and I get to learn something new too.
